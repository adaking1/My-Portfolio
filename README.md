## Description

This website was created to put my web development work in one place where potential employers, or anyone else can find it. 


## Usage

Select the topic of interest at the top of the creen and be redirected to page with topic (all topics on same page). When you select a project image it will link you to the deployed project. When you select one of the contact option, you will be directed to one of my social media pages or to start an email. When there are different sized screens, the wepage layout is responsive and changes to fit the screen
